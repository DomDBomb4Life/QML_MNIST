1. Choose the Right Quantum-Classical Framework

	•	Consider using a dedicated library for hybrid models like PennyLane or TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ). These frameworks provide built-in differentiable quantum layers compatible with TensorFlow, simplifying integration.

2. Optimize Data Encoding

	•	Explore more expressive data encoding techniques, such as Amplitude Encoding or Angle Encoding. This allows you to map classical data to quantum states more effectively without oversimplifying.

3. Use a Realistic Quantum Backend

	•	Switch to qasm_simulator for your quantum circuits to emulate actual hardware behavior, including measurement-based results. This ensures your results align with quantum hardware expectations.

4. Simplify Optimization

	•	Use hybrid optimization techniques that handle both quantum and classical parameters simultaneously. PennyLane’s gradient-based optimizers (qml.Adam) are designed for this purpose and integrate seamlessly.

5. Refactor Training for Efficiency

	•	Avoid per-sample quantum circuit execution. Batch processing and efficient simulators (e.g., using PennyLane’s qml.qnode) can drastically improve performance.

6. Modularize Experimentation

	•	Break the project into modular experiments:
	•	Test quantum circuits independently of TensorFlow.
	•	Validate your encoding strategy with classical models.
	•	Combine them iteratively rather than building a complex pipeline at the start.
