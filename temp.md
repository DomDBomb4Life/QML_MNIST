Design Philosophy and Justification
	•	Object-Oriented Approach: By defining classes for models, layers, trainers, and evaluators, the code becomes modular and maintainable. This structure allows you to develop and test components independently before integrating them.
	•	Quantum Emphasis for Physicists:
	•	Physics Terminology: Use variable and class names that resonate with quantum physics concepts (e.g., Hamiltonian, QuantumCircuit, Eigenstate).
	•	Clear Quantum Implementation: The quantum directory isolates quantum computing elements, making it easier to focus on the physics without getting lost in general programming logic.
	•	Mathematical Rigor: Implement quantum operations in a way that reflects their mathematical definitions, which will showcase your understanding of the underlying physics.
	•	Minimum Viable Product:
	•	Leverage Libraries: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for the classical parts to avoid unnecessary complexity.
	•	Simplicity in Quantum Circuits: Implement the quantum circuit with essential gates and avoid overcomplicating the circuit design.
	•	Focused Functionality: Implement core features first, such as training loops and basic models, before adding optional enhancements like advanced logging or visualization.

Implementation Notes
	•	Training Workflow:
	•	Classical Training: Utilize built-in optimizers (like Adam or SGD) provided by the machine learning library.
	•	Quantum Training: In the quantum_optimizer.py, use Qiskit’s optimization routines. Since quantum computations can be slow, start with a small subset of data to verify functionality before scaling up.
	•	Data Handling:
	•	Keep data loading efficient to reduce training time.
	•	Consider using data augmentation if time permits, but prioritize getting the basic pipeline working.
	•	Performance Comparison:
	•	In evaluator.py, ensure that metrics are calculated consistently between models.
	•	Present results in a way that highlights the differences and potential advantages of the quantum approach.
